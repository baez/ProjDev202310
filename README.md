# ProjDev202310

ProjDev202310 is a C# practice project that showcases structured software development with a focus on clean architecture, maintainability, and scalability. It serves as a demonstration of key software engineering principles, making it an excellent addition to a professional portfolio.

## Features

- **Structured Project Organization**: Follows best practices in organizing code for clarity and scalability.
- **Model-Driven Development**: Uses well-defined data models to structure application logic.
- **Repository Pattern Implementation**: Separates data access logic for better maintainability and testability.
- **Solution-Based Development**: Includes a Visual Studio solution file (`ProjDev220310.sln`) for easy setup and exploration.

## Project Structure

- `Models/` - Contains data models representing key entities within the application.
- `ProjDev220310/` - Core application logic, implementing business rules and operations.
- `Repositories2/` - Encapsulates data access logic to ensure separation of concerns.
- `ProjDev220310.sln` - The Visual Studio solution file to manage the project setup.
